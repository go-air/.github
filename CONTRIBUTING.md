# Contributing

Go-air projects follow some general contribution guidelines.

## Projects and Issues

Each public repo has a single GitHub project to help organise work.  Projects
can have notes or issues.  Issues are automatically present in the 
project board if they are labelled as belonging to the respective project. 
Please try to ensure that all issues are labelled with the project.

Projects are organised into 4 columns, "Backlog" (aka not as of yet planned), 
"To do" (aka planned), "In progress", "Done".

## Copyrights

Each public repo has a standard OSI license.  In order to contribute code
or copyrightable material in a commit into the repository, the committer
needs to agree to grant copyright rights to the project.  

Note many or most developers in the employ of a company do not have the right
to agree to this,it is rather the decision of their employer.

However, whether agreeing to grant copyright to the project is an act of 
an individual or an organisation, the process at Go-air is the same: 

1. The individual or a suitable representative their organisation must file 
an issue with label "cla" requesting to be added in the AUTHORs file.
2. If the filer of this issue is able, they should create a pull request 
with the change to the file.  If not, a maintainer will do this.  The
pull request will be reviewed and directed to the appropriate branch
for the project.
3. If the filing is on behalf of an organisation, it should provide contact
in the issue.  If this is not preferred, the contact information may
instead be mailed to the contact listed in the project's CODE_OF_CONDUCT instead.

## Reviews

We value reviews and attention to detail.  We normally spend several rounds of review. 
Often, the submitter of a work for review may decide to pursue a different 
solution.  If this is the case, the new, different solution should be pursued
in a different issue.  Please link the issues in the issue discussion to preserve
this relationship.

## Discussions

We use GitHub discussions as a place for higher level discussions, perhaps
coordinating several issues or one very big one, or perhaps just 
asking a question. Please use issues for specific, concrete technical 
issues such as bugs, benchmarks, feature requests, etc.  Discussions can
also be used to discuss the repository organisation.

Enjoy,

Go-air
