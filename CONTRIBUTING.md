# Contributing to Go-air

There are several ways to contribute to Go-air.  Please keep in
mind our code of conduct.

## Let us know what you are doing with the software.

Let us and everyone know if you are using our software.  If
so, how is it going?  What works well?  What can we improve?

## Asking questions.

Use our issue trackers to ask questions.

## Report bugs and nits.

File an issue on the repository for the software where you found a bug.  We
also welcome 'nit' reports which are things that bother the users but are not
really bugs.

## Discussions

Have an idea you would like us to explore?  Drop a note
in our discussion area associated with each repository. 


Go-air projects follow some general contribution guidelines.

## Developer Contributions

Each public repo has a single GitHub project to help organise work.  Projects
can have notes or issues.  Issues are automatically present in the 
project board if they are labelled as belonging to the respective project. 
Please try to ensure that all issues are labelled with the project.

Projects are organised into 4 columns, "Backlog" (aka not as of yet planned), 
"To do" (aka planned), "In progress", "Done".

### Copyrights

Each public repo has a standard OSI license.  In order to contribute code
or copyrightable material in a commit into the repository, the committer
needs to agree to grant copyright rights to the project.  

Note many or most developers in the employ of a company do not have the right
to agree to this,it is rather the decision of their employer.

However, whether agreeing to grant copyright to the project is an act of 
an individual or an organisation, the process at Go-air is the same: 

1. The individual or a suitable representative their organisation must file 
an issue with label "cla" requesting the right to be added in the AUTHORs file.  The
project should have this as an optional issue template when filing, with 
text pre-filled to grant rights to the project.
2. If the filer of this issue is able, they should create a pull request 
with the change to the file, or include the change in their first pull request. 
If the filer is not able, a maintainer will do this.  The
pull request will be reviewed and directed to the appropriate branch
for the project.
3. If the filing is on behalf of an organisation, it should provide contact info
for the organisation in the issue.  If this is not preferred, the contact 
information may instead be mailed to the contact listed in the project's 
CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT instead.
4. Once the associated pull request is merged, the request to grant
copy rights is granted.

### Reviews

We value reviews and attention to detail.  We normally spend several rounds of review. 
Often, things are learned in the review process and the submitter of a work for review 
may decide to pursue a different solution (Reviewers should however make every 
effort to be inclusive to new ideas).  If a different solution is pursued, it should
be in a different issue. Please link both issues in the issue discussion to preserve
this relationship.
